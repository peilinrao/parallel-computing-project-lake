## Execution

To run the code use:  

    mpiexec -n [k] python -m mpi4py .\lake_basic.py [method]
or 

    python -m mpi4py .\lake_basic.py [method]

First command can run any method but the second command cannot run method 4 or 5.  
k: any power of two value
method:   
(1) BF: Brute Force without any vectorization  
(2) DFT: Vectorized Discrete Fourier Transform  
(3) FFT: Vectorized Fast Fourier Transform  
(4) FFT_P: Vectorized MPI-Parallel Fast Fourier Transform  
(5) FFT_PC: Vectorized MPI-Parallel Fast Fourier Transform with Cuda Acceleration

## Summary
In this project, we use a method of simulating water surface with statistical model.
Using statistical model gives more realistic result but it is much more computational expensive than
the approximation model, which tends to oversimplify the water surface to a linear combination of
sin waves. After we implement this statistical model with the brute force algorithm, we modify it
to get a good vectorization version of SIMD optimization. Then, we find out the calculation in the
model can be decomposed into two Fourier transforms, which can be accelerated with Fast Fourier
Transform algorithm. We implement a parallel version of Fast Fourier Transfer with Message Passing
Interface. Finally, we add CUDA supports in our simulation which greatly reduces the computation
time. With MPI and CUDA, our implementation achieves a significant speedup compared to the
sequential version. We would like to elaborate our implementation and discussion experimental
results on different inputs. 

## Background
We would like to begin by giving some characteristics and constraints considered in the statistical
model before talking about its implementation, as the theory behind this model is entirely provided
by this paper Tessendorf (2004). We would not focus on any rendering problem such as lighting or
coloring since this is not a project for computer graphics course. Instead, we only consider the height
(y) change of a tile of points in 3D dimension with fixed x and z values. The output of our program is
the triangular mesh of those points moving over time.

## Challenge
Although we've did some research in the implementation of water wave simulation, the effect of this multiresolution dispersion kernel mechanism remains unclear for us. The determination of where, when and how to do synchronization between blocks is challenging. Besides, finding the balance between computational cost and simulation accuracy in this implementation can be hard.  We hope to learn good methods and give some improvement on parallizing computer graphics code in this project.

## Workload
There is a high communication to computation ratio in this pyramid generation kernels. Also the layers of adjustments (for example a rock is thrown into the lake, or some wind approaches the water surface, causing different particle behavior of the water surface) should be able to access with good locality and communicate between thread/blocks with the minimum information transfering.

## Constraints
The randomness of the disturbing position of the water surface can easily create workload imbalancing in parallization this computation. We need to find a good way to balance the workload per thread when different extents disturbing happens at arbitrary position.

## Goal and Deliverables

HOPE TO ACHIEVE ("75%"): fully functional parallelized water wave simulation without features such as reflecting boundary (wave reflects when touching the shore) and shadow mask propogation (a method that improves the efficient shared memory usage).  

PLAN TO ACHIEVE ("100%"): fully functional parallelized water wave simulation with features such as reflecting boundary and shadow mask propogation.  

EXTRA GOAL ("125")ï¼š improve the algorithm of multiresolution dispersion kernel with either better resolution/visual effects or better performance. 

Our poster session's demo would be interactive. Other students can see our lake simulation dynamically changing when they "throw" an object into the water. They can directly see the speedup by parallislem during any time period or over any action taken.  

## Platform Choice
We plan to use C++ with CUDA support for implementation and MPI for accelerating FFT. We choose to use CUDA since NVIDIA GPUs are the most common way to accelerate computer graphics algorithms.
## Schedule
3.23 - 4.11[Done]: read the paper and plan for our implementation <br />
4.11 - 4.20: implement the sequential version <br />
4.20 - 4.24: implement the naive parallel version, benchmark its performance. (Submit it for intermediate checkpoint) <br />
4.24 - 4.29: improve the parallel version of the program and draft the report with previous benchmarks <br />
4.29 - 5.5: prepare for the poster session 


## Milestone
As planned previously, we finished researching about [wave equations and algorithms](http://www.coastalwiki.org/wiki/Shallow-water_wave_theory#Derivation_of_the_Airy_Wave_equations) needed for the sequential version of our lake simulator. We have a demo with python and matplotlib about the fluid propagation.

We still believe that we are able to produce all the deliverables. We plan to show a demo about the sequential and GPU accelerated version of lake simulations at the poster sessino. We have no preliminary results since we have not started to build the GPU version of it. The main concern we have right now is the package choice for animation representation since matplotlib might not have good GPU support. If this turns out to be true, we will try to find another graphics package that has generic GPU support. We plan to use numba for GPU computation acceleration on python programs. The revised timeline is also updated above in the schedule section.
